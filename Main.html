        <div>
            <p>My name is Ayah. This is the first website I have ever created and hoping to create many more that are more professional, beautiful and user-centric. <br>
            I have graduated from Dalhousie University with a double major in Biology and Math. I have always been passionate about the IT field, but I did not <br>
            know how to start my career in it. So, I joined the NSCC in the IT campus in 2023 to gain the knowledge and necessary skills to have a new career in <br>
            something that I am passionate about. I am looking forward to developing and growing my knowledge and skills, hoping that one day I can create and <br>
            design my personal website. Please look under my Linkedin tab to learn more about my journey in the professional field. I also love looking at galaxy <br>
            and naturalistic photos. I find that those types of pictures are especially captivating to look at. Furthermore, I have embedded a link above to my <br>
            favourite wallpapers. The background you see in my website was taken from there.

            <h1>Clean Water and Sanitation</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Clean water and sanitation are indispensable for thriving communities and are pivotal for a healthy, sustainable future. In the complex tapestry <br>
            of global development, the availability of these basic necessities serves as a litmus test for the well-being of a nation. Picture a society where water <br>
            is a precious resource and sanitation is a luxury rather than a right. In such conditions, the lack of access to clean water becomes a pressing issue <br>
            that permeates every aspect of life, jeopardizing health, hindering education, and stifling economic progress. Amidst the conflict in Gaza, the critical <br>
            importance of clean water and sanitation cannot be overstated. As the region faces the devastating impact of war, the scarcity of clean water poses <br>
            immediate health risks, compounds challenges faced by families, hampers education, exacerbates economic struggles, and perpetuates a cycle of hardship. <br>
            Addressing this urgent need is not just an infrastructure concern but a vital step towards safeguarding the well-being and dignity of the people in Gaza.

            <h1>Professional Background</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I have worked at multiple places through out my life. The place that I worked the longest at was <br>
                Immigrant Services Association of Nova Scotia <a href="https://isans.ca/"><u>(ISANS)</u></a>. I have started my journey with them as <br>
                an interpreter for immigrants who were not able to speak English very well. After that I worked <br>
                in translation services and finally, I became an intake counsellor. I was one of the initial counsellors <br>
                who worked with the Atlantic immigration Program 
                <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration.html"><u>(AIP)</u></a>. 
                I loved working there  because I was <br>
                meeting lots of new clients and I was lucky to be introduced to different 
                cultures. <br>Currently I am working toward my goal of becoming a professional full stack web developer.
